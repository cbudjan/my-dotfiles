## my-dotfiles ##

My current dotfile setup.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with **homesick/homeshick** (https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) and should be cloned into .homesick/repos/

Simply 

    homesick clone https://github.com/cbudjan/my-dotfiles.git

    homesick link my-dotfiles

to symlink the dotfiles to the home folder.

*aliases.zsh* is sourced into *.zshrc* and is used together with **oh-my-zsh**.

Clone latest version of **oh-my-zsh directly** from https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh

## TODO: ##

Set up tmux and push to dotfile repo.
